Welcome to the **Refacotring Tools** - open-source eclipse plugins that will assist you in writing **clean code, refactoring** etc.  

## [Stench Blossom](https://github.com/CaptainEmerson/refactoring-tools/wiki/Stench-Blossom)
A novel code smell detector that provides an interactive ambient visualization designed to first give programmers a quick, high-level overview of the smells in their code, and then, if they wish, to help in understanding the sources of those code smells.
